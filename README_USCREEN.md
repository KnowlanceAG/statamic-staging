### Including CPSSG addon: an adjusted SSG plugin

[CPSSG](https://gitlab.uscreen.net/uscreen/statamic-addons/cpssg) is a plugin designed to create static html pages and assets (js, css). As the static result has no backend to handle data from contact forms, the plugin creates several routes to contact the dynamic backend.

The CPSSG addon is capable of generating files for different vhosts.
